## Shopper AI Overview

You can ask questions questions about what products to buy and it will provide suggestions.

e.g.

> Query: i want to build a drain for my driveway

> Response: To build a drain for your driveway, you will need several items. Here are some suggestions available on Amazon:
> 
> 1. Channel Drain System: Consider purchasing a channel drain system, which includes a channel trench, grate, and outlet. This will help collect and direct water away from your driveway.
> 
> 2. Trenching Shovel: Use a trenching shovel to dig the necessary trench for the drain system.
> 
> 3. Perforated Pipe: You will need a perforated pipe to connect to the channel drain and carry the water away from the driveway. Ensure the pipe is compatible with the channel drain system you choose.
> 
> 4. PVC Pipe Fittings: Purchase PVC pipe fittings such as elbows, connectors, and couplers to connect the perforated pipe and create a functional drain system.
> 
> 5. Geotextile Fabric: To prevent sediment or debris from clogging the drain, use geotextile fabric to line the trench before installing the channel and pipe.
> 
> 6. Gravel: Use gravel to create a stable base in the trench and around the pipe for proper drainage.
> 
> 7. Concrete Mix: If necessary, buy concrete mix to secure the channel drain and create a stable structure.
> 
> 8. Saw or Cutter: Depending on the chosen channel drain system, you may need a saw or cutter to trim or adjust the length of the channel trench or pipe.
> 
> Remember to check specific measurements and requirements for your driveway before purchasing these items. Additionally, always consult local regulations and guidelines before undertaking any drainage project.
